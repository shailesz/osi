Also got a new guitar, sweet right? It has been my goal to learn a few musical instruments, i figured guitar would be the first one i learn. I was listening to Dire Straits one day and yk their music is fire, will learn to play that song. This past month, my dad fell ill, had to stay in the hospital for a few days. I also took my 8th semester exams. Yes sir, i am a free bird now. Was also doing a project, which floped! I am smiling writing this. teehee.",
