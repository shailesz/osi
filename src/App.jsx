            <span className="post-date">Aug 07 -</span> Hello world! didn't mean
            to start in a crappy way but it is what it is. i have never written
            personal blogs and this is a fresh start. i believe i will keep this
            blog going and turn writing into a habit. i have always been wanting
            to start writing a blog and today i just found that little push i
            needed. here's to a new hobby in the making ðŸ¥‚
          </p>

            what i feel today: some people come into your life and
            bless you with inspiration
